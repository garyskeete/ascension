Here's what Watson can do conceptually
Adhere to the programming of your website on GitHub
Take existing programming and convert it to standards of medical code programming
That code enabling the molecular genetic and cellular to be tabulated and reinstated
A listing of all genes proteins DNA all microscopic criteria including pathways
A simulation of a living organism undergoing death
The reversal from a stage of rotting and apoptosis rebirth reanimation
A look at the regenerative powers of a certain powder that can replace fingers
A complete restoration including a systematic attempt at suspended animation and resuscitation

So determinations through mental processes dealing with the visual centre of the brain and determinate factors in planning dream analysis control measures feelings of inadequacy guilt superiority submission and suicidal ideation leading to adverse behaviour such as anger and criminal acts profanity and obscene language driven by an taste for the unknown a vision of an open road and an adrenal gland dictating dangerous behaviours and an unknown unmet unrecognized need for attention

The advocation of a set of genetic parameters the biomarkers the signalling pathways the protein interactions all in algorithms designed to promote the indication of communication and response by integration of film and photographs put together with inference to historical data bills videos written proofs evidence discovery and indicators to determine a storyline that is predicted through scientific methods of discovery such as  an adaptive approach to carbon dating ( the transformation of the dating mechanism to a search mechanism for DNA recognition)DNA reconstruction through transformation of elements in a photograph or video to chemical structures deriving formulation analysis and self assembly polymerization and reanimation leading to Resuscitation.

Another alternative is to adapt a qubit in quantum computing to the image of the person adapting all characteristics of movement assumed body language and physical pressures and stresses.
Then without delay track the movement of the individual on a specially designed map that adheres to the progress of the movement of the aligned qubit taking a clue in the direction the suspect was last seen heading.
Further evaluation could be done through quantum entanglement of the qubit location through placement of the qubit in the video classes sent and confirmation of matching results throughout the globe.

The specially designed map would encompass having a rendition of desired surroundings in virtual reality and tracking movement through qubit placement and reality to virtual animation interface seeing the image of the suspect tracked by qubit in virtual reality

Visualize the image in the picture matching as many characteristics throughout the image height approximate weight eye colour ambulation posture movement reflexes running stance area where clothing was bought identifying cameras of all who bought clothing resembling characteristics process of elimination bills store cameras video surveillance in supermarkets for movements characteristics identification of where bag was purchased any further identification such as similarities on satellite tracking or a DNA map of characteristics that match

The eventual conclusion being communication with a reconstructed photograph of the individual including AI DNA composition through analysis of breath chemistry or eye recognition leading to the rebuilding of a epigenetic and computerized neuroscience reconstruction of a communicable clone that can relate to questioning
