 Computational Counterterrorism AntiCrime AntiDisease Techniques Technology

The concept of RAM gates with ROM Gates AND gates and NAND gates and NOR gates As examples the belief that terrorism is somewhat reliant on the access to information the prom and the distinct connection to computerized timed sequences that are recorded to circumvent the legal system coded in commonly used messages that invoke over time a hypnotic state which results in a trigger mechanism leading to adverse programmed behaviour
So like the computerized highways in the Git Real Intro individuals fall into sequence juxtapositioning themselves like taken from example shown as ROM gates and in the programmable logic
http://sce2.umkc.edu/csee/hieberm/281_new/lectures/combinational/storage-components.html as Git repositories
So the possibility of an additional or outside combatant would be added in sequence to the appropriate branch or master
The AND gate reacts to SQL tables listing the sorted combinations titles (and the NAND gates are Boolean function) mathematical configurations according to their truths the NOR gates being the deciding factor in positive identifications.
So if the RAM gates being considered are the gates of Heaven in concept the precious stones being the significance in representation we have implemented the Ruby language-see correlation from Code School.
In concert with the RAM gates are the names the commands the Operons and the memory all programming individual sources of information resulting in calculated effort.
So the efforts of Lone wolves homegrown terrorists and suspects can be tracked. It can also be used for Law enforcement or Disease fighting mechanisms
The RAM gates being the access to Heaven see http://GitHub.com/garyskeete
